## Problem Description

**<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>Primary objectives:</span>**

This project aims to use data and modeling to explore and predict tags for questions on Stack Exchange.The primary objectives are as follows:

1.  Data Extraction

2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3.  Machine Learning Model Development

## Why is it interesting?

1.  **Real-world Application**: Improving tag prediction for Stack Exchange and other platforms could benefit millions of users.

2.  **Data-Driven Insights**: EDA can reveal user behavior, popular topics, and challenges on Stack Exchange.

3.  **Automation**: Automating tag prediction can save time and improve efficiency for moderators and users.

4.  **User Experience Improvement**: Accurate tagging improves user engagement by making it easier to find relevant content.

## Analytics Plan - Exploratory Data Analysis

**<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>List of EDA tasks:</span>**

1.  Monthly questions count

2.  Percentage marked as answered vs. questions

3.  Relationships between answers and users

4.  Common words/tags in titles

5.  Growth or shrinking of particular tags over time

## Methods and Tools

1.  **API Integration (httr package)**: httr will be used to interact with APIs and retrieve data for analysis.

2.  **Data Visualization (ggplot)**: ggplot will be used to visualize data patterns and model performance.

3.  **Machine Learning Libraries (H2O, Keras)**: H2O, Keras and other models will be utilized as the machine learning frameworks.
